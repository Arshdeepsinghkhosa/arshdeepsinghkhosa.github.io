## Bio ##

I'm a Ph.D. Scholar in the [Division of Dairy Economics, Statistics and Management](http://ndri.res.in/divisions/dairy-economics-statistics-and-management/) at the [ICAR - National Dairy Research Institute](http://ndri.res.in/), Karnal, HR, India. I am the 2020 recepient of the [R. T. Doshi Best Presentation Award (2nd Prize)](http://aeraindia.in/bestpaperpresentation) during the 28th  Agricultural Economics Research Association (AERA) (India) for the paper [Interlink between factor and product markets: Opportunity for the future of Indian agriculture](https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/310338?ln=en). The title of my (ongoing) Ph.D. thesis is [Impact evaluation of anionic mineral mixture supplementation on milk production and the milk fever: A randomized controlled trial](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/5108). In this I evaluate the impact of a preventive health product on animal and human welfare. I received a B. Sc. (Agriculture) degree from University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru, KA in 2012 and an M. Sc. (Agri) in Agricultural Economics from University of Agricultural Sciences, Raichur, KA in 2016.

My research interests include impact evaluation, agricultural markets and its interlink, agricultural finance and agricultural policy evaluation.
